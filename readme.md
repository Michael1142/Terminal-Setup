## Post install instructions

* You need to set your terminal font to a powerline patched font.
* Set the font by opening iTerm2 pressing cmd + \",\" and going to profiles -> text -> selecting Fira Code as the Font.
* You may want to enable font ligatures or change the theme if you're feeling extra fancy...
* To enable cmd and opt to jump around text in iterm go to preferences -> profiles -> keys -> key mappings and select "Natural Text Encoding" from the Presets...
